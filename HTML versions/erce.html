<b>July 2013</b>: Expressions of Interest in the ERCE programme are now requested. Each interested institute is asked to send us a brief description of its activities, and its suitability, together with a covering letter and supporting material. The preliminary deadline for application or expression of interest is 28th February 2014. Further information can be found <a href = "erceadv13.pdf">here</a>.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
The focus of this project is the education of students in the developed world to the Masters level. We aim to tailor our approach so that it is appropriate to the different levels of development that exist in different parts of the world. 
</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  
To train mathematicians from the least developed regions to say the
Masters level, it is not efficient, nor necessary, to send them to
institutions of the highest level. Indeed among the 
emerging economical regions there are very good centres which
can train mathematicians to the Masters level and higher.  
<!--
Among these we can cite many in Brazil, China, India, South Africa, 
Vietnam, etc.   
-->
After the Master's degree, if the student is capable, 
then we can try to find ways of sending him or her to Europe to do a
Ph.D.  In fact, <a href="http://ems-cdc.org">EMS-CDC</a>, in collaboration with 
<a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/">CIMPA</a>, has already 
educated a Cambodian student in Vietnam to Masters level,  with two
more doing the course in 2010/2011.
</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  
It is in this spirit that our committee wishes to propose a scheme of 
<b> Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence (ERCE)</b>.  The idea is for EMS
to select, endorse and help a number of such centres to offer training
to M.Sc. level to students from less developed countries in their 
region. Following the above encouraging example, provided there are 
institutions in the emerging economies who are interested in 
participating, and with the backing of the EMS, our committee is 
confident that such a scheme will work well.
</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  
We have spoken of this idea to a number of mathematicians and the
reaction has been really positive.  This includes the President of the
European Mathematical Society, colleagues in South America, South
Africa and Asia.  The first label ERCE has been attributed in 2011 to the 
<a href="http://www.sms.edu.pk/">
Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences</a> in Lahore, Pakistan.  If 
we can get funding from the European Commission then we can 
help to build up the infrastructure of these centres in many practical 
ways.  But even without much funding, we can use our expertise and our 
connections to reinforce centres in many material ways. 
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  
The advantages of such a procedure are threefold:<br />
<ol>
<li> It is cheaper in general to send a student to a nearby country
       or region.
<li> The student will be less disoriented, and in some cases, they
       may not need a higher European degree.
<li> The educating institution will gain experience and prestige.
</ol>
</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  
Before we put this into action, we should bear in mind several points.
<ol>
<li> Such a scheme involves no financial cost to EMS.
<li> We should set up precise criteria, which would have to be accepted
       by EC, and which we shall apply in our selection.
<li> Will there be institutions interested, and what advantages we 
       can offer them?
<li> On the other hand, there may be too many institutions who want 
       to bear the label EMS-ERCE.
<li> We have to consider the position of some prestigious
       institutions in the emerging economies (e.g. 
<a href="http://www.tifr.res.in/">TIFR</a>, Mumbai, or 
<a href="http://www.impa.br/opencms/en/">IMPA</a>, Rio).  
</ol>
</p><p>
To take the above points into consideration,  we have issued a 
<a href="newsletter79p11-12.pdf">
Call for Applications/Expression of Interest for the label</a> <i>Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence (EMS-ERCE)</i>.  This advertisement has been issued in the 
<a href="http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2011-03-79.pdf">EMS newsletter 79 (March 2011) p.11-12</a>.  
In this call we made clear:
<ol>
<li> We should set up a clear list of criteria, including what such
       a centre is expected to collaborate in.
<li> We should list the advantages to the institutions if they get
       to participate.
<li> We could reduce the number of applications to something we can 
       handle by staggering the regions.  For instance we could start with a 
       pilot scheme involving only the Indian subcontinent, or
       southern Asia, with a clear declaration of intent to extend the 
       scheme to other regions.
<li> Such a label will be given for a period of four years,
       renewable thereafter. 
<li> Prestigious institutions are of course welcome to apply, if
       the scheme interests them.  In that case, they would add lustre
       to the scheme.
</ol>
</</p><p>
The list of criteria we think appropriate:
<ol>
<li> The centre is of good scientific standing in the region 
       and neighboring regions.
<li> It has a good track record both in research and in pedagogy.
<li> The centre has a fairly international outlook.
<li> The centre has good, reasonably guaranteed long-term prospects.
<li> The centre is willing to admit and educate graduate
       students from less developed regions.  It should have the
       infrastructure to do so, e.g. the language of instruction should 
       preferably be in one of the main European languages (English, 
       French or Spanish). 
<li> The degree aimed at is M.Sc., and Ph.D. in exceptional cases.
<li> The centre is willing to welcome well-established 
       foreign visiting mathematicians for collaboration in research 
       and for teaching graduate courses.
</ol>
</p><p> 
The advantages for the centre are:
<ol>
<li> The label can add prestige and visibility to the centre, which will
       most probably attract more and better students. 
<li> Often this will in turn attract funding from local and regional
       sources. 
<li> The members of CDC will be there to give support and advice 
       whenever needed.  Since this will be considered part of our 
       direct mission, they will get priority of our time and resources.
<li> CDC will be on hand to help those of the students who might
       wish to and who are capable of continuing their studies after 
       their M.Sc.
<li> CDC will try to send experienced lecturers to give short or medium courses, e.g. by involving the 
	<a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~imu.cdc/vlp/">Volunteer Lecturer Program</a> 
sponsored by the 
	<a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~imu.cdc/dcsg/activities.php">Developing Countries Strategy Group (DSCG)</a>
of the 
	<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/">International Mathematical Union</a>, 
in cooperation with 
	<a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/">CIMPA</a>
and the 
	<a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/biso/IMU/index.htm">U.S National Committee for Mathematics</a>.  
<li> CDC will seek European hosts for researchers from these centres 
       for visits or collaborations, or both.
<li> CDC will make available small grants for members of the centres
       to attend conferences, when appropriate.  
</ol></p><p>  
If all works according to plan, then the ERCE will provide education 
in less developed regions and will, in exchange, get help to further 
develop themselves.  It looks to be a very advantageous scheme for
all.  At the same time, with relatively small expenditure a larger number of 
students can receive their first graduate education, in a culture not 
too removed from their own.  This will be a practical and efficient
way for mathematicians to help other mathematicians.
