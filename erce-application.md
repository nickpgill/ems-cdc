To apply for the ERCE label, please fill in the registration form below. For more details about the ERCE programme <a href = "erce">go to the main ERCE page</a>.

If you decide to apply, please take careful note of the following: For your application to be successful, the application must contain basic information like the name and place of the institution, academic affiliation, address and other relevant contact information. If a multi university center, clarify the institution's position in the academic structure.

Let us reiterate the criteria for receiving the ERCE label:
 1. The centre is of good scientific standing in the region and neighboring regions.
 2. It has a good track record both in research and in pedagogy.
 3. The centre has a fairly international outlook.
 4. The centre has good, reasonably guaranteed long-term prospects.
 5. The centre is willing to admit and educate graduate
       students from less developed regions.  It should have the
       infrastructure to do so, e.g. the language of instruction should 
       preferably be in one of English, 
       French or Spanish. 
 6. The degree aimed at is M.Sc., and Ph.D. in exceptional cases.
 7. The centre is willing to welcome well-established 
       foreign visiting mathematicians for collaboration in research 
       and for teaching graduate courses.
 8. The centre should assist smaller centres nearby - the label should have a positive effect not only for the selected institution, but more widely for the development of mathematics in the region.

The application must also elaborate in detail on all the criteria for participation - but especially 4, 5, 7 and 8 - how and when these criteria can be met in the institution's specific context.
It's helpful if you provide your research output in terms of publications for the last ten years."
