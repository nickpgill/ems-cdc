<p>
We aim to send books and journals donated by mathematicians in
the developed world to institutes and departments in the developing
world. We have received quite a number of generous offers: from
individuals who retire, from institutes/libraries getting rid of
excess stock, from libraries going digital, and also from publishers'
surplus.  We continue to welcome such generosity.
</p><p>
On the other hand, we also have a list of recipients: those who have 
promised to make available to all local mathematicians freely the 
donated material, and to keep it in good condition. This list is 
ever expanding, and we welcome any such institutes to contact us for 
this purpose. 
</p><p>
The shipping costs are high, but we are supported 
financially, on a case-by-case basis, by 
<a href="http://math.ictp.it/">ICTP</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/donations/donations">American Mathematical Society</a>, 
<a href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/index.html">London Mathematical Society</a>, 
<a href="http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/partners/">Zentralblatt</a>,
<a href="http://www.siu.no/en/Programme-overview/The-NUFU-programme">The Norwegian Programme for Development, Research and Education (NUFU)</a>, 
and also our own very limited funds. We have moved tens of tonnes of books and journals, from Europe, USA and Canada, to 
Africa, South East Asia, and South and Central America.
