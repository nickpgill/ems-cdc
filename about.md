The Committee for Developing Countries is a committee of the <a href="http://euro-math-soc.eu/" title="The European Mathematical Society">European Mathematical Society (EMS)</a>; its terms of reference can be found <a href = "http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/committee/developing-countries">here</a>. We presented a <a href = "poster2018.pdf">poster</a> at ICM2018 which describes our recent work.

# Members

A full list of our members can be found <a href = "members">here</a>.

# Aims and Objectives
We aim to assist developing countries in all possible ways. Some examples:
 * the development of mathematics curricula;
 * cooperation with local staff in conducting M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs;
 * helping to build up libraries;
 * helping to build up regional centres and networks;
 * providing information about further studies for students from developing regions;
 * sourcing funds for junior and senior researchers to attend conferences.

The CDC work is based on the volunteering participation of its members and associate members. We are full of ideas, and there is lots of work to be done.  We do not receive regular funding from our parent society <a href="http://euro-math-soc.eu/">EMS</a>, and so desperately need help from all mathematicians!
