<h3> 
Aims and Objectives
</h3> 
We aim to assist developing countries in all possible ways. Some examples:
<ul>
<li> the development of mathematics curricula;
<li> cooperation with local staff in conducting M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs;
<li>  helping to build up libraries;
<li> helping to build up regional centres and networks;
<li> providing information about further studies for students from developing regions;
<li> sourcing funds for junior and senior researchers to attend conferences.
</ul>
<p>The CDC work is based on the volunteering participation of its members and associate members. We are full of ideas, and there is lots of work to be done.  We do not receive regular funding from our parent society <a href="http://euro-math-soc.eu/">EMS</a>, and so desperately need help from all mathematicians!
</p>

<h3>
Meetings
</h3>
<p>
In 2016 the CDC met on 8-9 April at ICTP Trieste, Italy.
</p><p>
During its annual meetings the CDC organises a round table for reflecting around various topics related to the promotion of mathematics worldwide. These meetings feature the participation of the CDC associate members and some institutes, associations, and centres sharing some of the same goals as the CDC.
</p><p>
This year the meeting has seen the active participation of : 
<ul>
<li> <a href = "http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/IndividualReports/CIMPA2016.pdf">CIMPA Centre des Mathématiques Pures et Appliquée</a>;
<li> <a href = "https://portal.ictp.it/math">ICTP Math Group</a> hosting the meeting;
<li> <a href = "http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/IndividualReports/CWM2016.pdf">IMU Committee for Women in Mathematics</a>;
<li> <a href = "http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/IndividualReports/TWASpresentation2016.pdf">World Academy of Sciences</a>;
<li> <a href = "http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/IndividualReports/OWSD2016.pdf">Organisation for Women in Sciences for the Developing World</a>. 
</ul>
The topic of the round table was: <i>Regional South-South Cooperation</i>.

<h3> 
Our activities (past, present and future)
</h3>
We started work in earnest in 2002. Since then we have expanded our aims and been involved in a number of projects.
<ul>
<li> <b>Agreement with <a href="http://www.zbmath.org/">zbMATH</a></b>: free access for Developing Countries. Details of this scheme are <a href="zbmath.php">here</a>.
<li> <b>Book donation scheme</b>: More details are <a href="donation.php">here</a>. New donors and recipients are always welcome. We have already moved tens of 
tonnes of books and journals, from Europe, USA, Canada, to 
Africa, South East Asia, and South and Central America. 
<li> <b>Funding conferences</b>:  Decisions to support a conference are taken once a year, during our annual meeting in April. 
We have funded participants to ICM06 in Madrid, a speaker to Mongolia, part of a <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/">CIMPA</a> 
school, part of the <a href = "http://www.europeanwomeninmaths.org/resources/news/creation-awma-african-women-in-mathematics-association">2nd African Women Mathematics workshop</a>, and so on.
<li> <b>Electronic access</b>: One member of the committee, <a href="http://math.golonka.org/">Anders Wandahl</a>,  has run <a href = "http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php">four workshops on electronic access</a>. The first, in Addis Ababa, was facilitated with a grant from the 
<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/">International Mathematical Union (IMU)</a> and attracted 47 participants. The second took place in Bamako, Mali in November 2010 during a 
<a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/spip.php?article236">CIMPA Research 
School</a>. The other two were in Maputo and Phnom Penh.
<br>
Members of <b>Electronic access subcommittee</b>:  
<i>	 
<a href="http://www.dm.unito.it/~fino/">Anna Fino</a>,   	
<a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~miw/">Michel Waldschmidt</a>,
<a href="http://math.golonka.org/">Anders Wandahl</a></i> (Chair of the subcommittee). 
</i> The CDC is open to facilitate such activity at request of interested parties. To present a motion of interest please contact <i>CDC-apply@euro-math-soc.eu</i>.
<li> <b>Mentoring</b>: We participate in the project entitled <a href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/mentoring-african-research-mathematics">Mentoring African Research Mathematics (MARM)</a>.
<li> <b>Reduced EMS Membership</b>: A special reduced fee of 5€ for mathematicians who reside in a developing country from 
<a href="http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/reduced-membership-fees">this list </a> was established by our Committee.
More details on the advantages of membership can be found
<a href="http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/individual-members">on the EMS website</a>. 
</ul>

<h3>Past activities</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Cambodian students</b>: We have supported a number of Cambodian students through their M.Sc. studies. In July 2013, we were
very pleased to receive news of the <a href = "http://www.lepetitjournal.com/cambodge/accueil/en-bref/159798-diplome-le-1er-docteur-en-math-du-cambodge">first PhD student in mathematics in Cambodia</a>.
<li> <b>Conference discussions</b> We held a roundtable at 5ECM and a discussion group at ICM10.
<li> <b>Twinning</b>: Until 2012 we had a <a href = "twinning.php">twinning scheme</a> under which we could provide a starting seed grant of around 500 Euros to facilitate the twinning of departments in developed and developing regions. Since this program was not active for many months, it is is not continued, but we could revive it in case of need.
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/">The Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR)! </a> (Germany). 
</ul>
Members are also active in other committees for developing countries 
around the world, notably within 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/">The International Mathematical Union (IMU)</a>, 

<li>
<a href="http://www.iciam.org/DCS/">International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM)</a>, ICIAM Conference Support for
Applied and Industrial Mathematics
in Developing Countries

</ul>
<p>
In addition to committee members we have associates who help us in our work, in many ways.  
</p>
<p> 
We regularly receive donations from reviewers of  <a href="http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/">Zentralblatt</a>. In 2010, we had an donation of 578.29 Euros from one Japanese reviewer, which was wonderful.
