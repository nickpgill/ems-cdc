Dear Friends and Colleagues,
<br />
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  It is with the utmost sadness that we learnt of the untimely death
of our friend and colleague Mikael Passare. 

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  
  Mikael officially joined the Committee for Developing Countries of
the European Mathematical Society in 2008, but many of us knew him as
a treasured colleague for much much longer.  In spite of his very busy
schedule he always had time for CDC business.  He was our Treasurer,
and following our tradition but unlike treasurers of other commitees, was 
relaxed about what we spent, since he believed in our work. He
attended all our meetings, greatly contributed to the serious but
genial atmosphere.  As we all know, he was a great linguist and he
used to speak French with our francophone colleagues, much to their
content.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  
   Even before Mikael joined us, we all heard of his great
travelling.  Although many of our members do travel a lot, we all
believe that Mikael surpassed us all.  In spite of his experience in
meeting people, Mikael was actually quite shy, and even to the extent
of appearing diffident.  But that was only an appearance, because
where work in development was concerned, he was not shy to express his
opinions, which were so useful to us.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  
   It is not for us to speak of his work in mathematics, nor of his
great contribution to ISP.  His other colleagues will testify to that 
amply.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  
   We just want to repeat, because this is from our hearts, what a
tragedy it is.  Somehow one feels that it is not fair that such a rich
and useful life should be cut short at its prime.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  
   We send our deepest sympathy to Mikael's family and his close
colleagues.  We feel deeply their loss, which is also ours.
