CDC opens a call for application of Patronage from CDC for those Mathematical activities that are held in Developing countries or that involve significantly many participants from Developing Countries. 

The patronage implies the permission to list CDC-EMS as one of the patronage institutions to the activity; display the CDC-EMS logo on the web site, poster and other printed material.

This activity would be benefit: 
  * CDC-EMS, since it would give an opportunity of international visibility in ideal locations where its activities could be advertised;
  * organisers that hold the patronage, since they could benefit from an authoritative recognition of value and they could use the patronage in other grant applications.
