We recently came across a <a href = "https://study.com/resources/scholarships-for-black-college-students">Financial Aid and Scholarship Guide for Black Students</a>. The guide is aimed at black students in the US. The guide contains:

 * Information on finding and applying for scholarships
 * A list of scholarships for black students at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels
 * Information on HBCUs and why they're important
 * A list of scholarships for students wanting to attend an HBCUs
 * Organizations and resources that are helpful for Black students and students of color.
