### New call of the IMU-CDC Graduate Assistantships in Developing Countries Program (GRAID)


The Program provides modest support for emerging research groups, working in a developing country listed in Priority 1 or 2 of the IMU Definition, making it possible for them to fund their most talented students to study full-time and pursue a Master or PhD graduate degree in mathematics.

We invite applications from Teams consisting of a Principal Investigator plus his or her research group and an International Partner by March 15, 2020.

The Principal Investigator should be a university professor in mathematics holding a PhD, working at a university or research centre in a developing country listed in Priority 1 or 2 of the IMU Definition, who is already training mathematics Masterâ€™s or PhD students and who is part of a research group. The International Partner should be a mathematician working at a university or research centre not based in any of the countries listed in Priority 1 or 2 of the IMU Definition. At the time of application there should be an active and ongoing collaboration between the International Partner and Principal Investigator.


This program is managed by the GRAID Subcommittee and the American Mathematical Society.
