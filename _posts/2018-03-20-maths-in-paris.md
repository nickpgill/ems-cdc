The lectures by famous mathematicians will go from number theory to mathematical biology, from graphs and combinatorics to the mathematics of particle accelerators. There will also be problem solving activities, mathematical games and cultural visits to discover Paris and its area both from the touristic and the scientific perspective. If you are between 16 and 20 years of age, or between two years before and two years after your high school degree, and if you love mathematics, then apply !
