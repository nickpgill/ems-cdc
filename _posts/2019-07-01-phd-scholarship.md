Expressions of interest are now open for the UNSW Scientia PhD Scholarship Scheme which provides individualised support and a generous funding package for career development. We are looking for candidates for a project on <a href = "https://www.scientia.unsw.edu.au/scientia-phd-scholarships/long-term-care-insurance-and-services-china>Long-Term Care Insurance and Services in China</a>. Applications close 12 July


**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**: This project studies the development of long-term care insurance and services in China. The project will make three contributions: 
 1. We will document different models of long-term care service provision, funding and governing structure that have emerged in China. 
 2. We will analyse the costs associated with different long-term care arrangements. 
 3. We will analyse the scalability of different long-term care models to the level needed given Chinaâ€™s rapid population ageing. The project will be supervised by an interdisciplinary team of top researchers in the field.

 - a degree in Economics, Actuarial Studies, Social Policy or a related discipline
