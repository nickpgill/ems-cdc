The International Mathematical Union (IMU), in collaboration with TWAS, The World Academy of Sciences, is opening a new call of the IMU Breakout Graduate Fellowship program to support postgraduate studies, in a developing country, leading to a PhD degree in the mathematical sciences. Professional mathematicians are invited to nominate highly motivated and mathematically talented students from developing countries who plan to complete a doctoral degree in a developing country, including their own home country. Nominees must have a consistently good academic record and must be seriously interested in pursuing a career of research and teaching in mathematics.

For full details on eligibility criteria and the online nomination form, please see <a href = "https://www.mathunion.org/cdc/scholarshipsgraduate-scholarships/imu-breakout-graduate-fellowship-program">here</a>.

Conditions for the Nominator (Professional Mathematician):
Professional mathematicians (including those who have superannuated, but continue to mentor young students). It is preferable that the nominator has been mentoring the nominee.

Conditions for the Nominee (Student):
The student must be A) resident AND B) a citizen of a developing country.  
The student must either:
        A) be pre-accepted to join a doctoral program in the first academic year after the time of selection in a university or research institution which is based on a developing country. OR
        B) already be enrolled in a doctoral program in a university or research institution which is based on a developing country.  
There is no age limit for the student.
Nomination for women students is strongly encouraged.
