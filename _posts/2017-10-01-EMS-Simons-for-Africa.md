The African Continent is very diversified and the development of a career in mathematics faces different and sometimes difficult progression. The Committee for Developing Countries (CDC) of the EMS, with the support of the <a href="http://www.simonsfoundation.org">Simons Foundation</a>, has opened a program of research visits to foster research opportunities for young and established researchers.

The aim is to promote individual career possibilities with consequence of an improved global capacity in African academic institutions. The program is open to all areas of pure and applied mathematics and statistics and it is directed to fellows based in Africa.

For all applications there are four deadlines:

 * February 15th
 * May 15th
 * September 15th
 * November 15th
