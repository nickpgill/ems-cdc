We have recently put out a call to our <a href="erce.php">ERCE centres</a> because the EMS has made some funds available for visits and conferences at the centres.

If you are putting in an application, then please remember that we need the following information:
- CV of the applicants
- letters of support
- full details on motivation, description, structure, impact of the research visit/activity proposed
- Budget request detailed description
- Other relevant information

When you have this information available, please email it to **nick.gill@southwales.ac.uk**
