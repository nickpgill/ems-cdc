In light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation we have some good news and some bad news:

   * The bad news: we are cancelling the next two calls for applications from the <a href = "https://euro-math-soc.eu/ems-simons-africa">EMS-Simons for Africa</a> fund. These were initially scheduled for 15th May 2020 and 15th September 2020.
   * The good news: Springer Nature is providing free acess to 500 key textbooks as a response to the pandemic.
