This document gives a brief report on activities 2017 -- 18.
 
### Overview of the scheme

The program directed to fellows based in Africa, consists in providing different grants for research visit to foster research opportunities both for young and established researchers working on all areas of pure and applied mathematics and statistics.

The aim is to promote individual career possibilities with the consequence of an improved global capacity in African academic institutions. 

We allocated several grants during the 4 deadlines (February 15th, May 15th, September 15th, November 15th).

 - **A1** research stays for experienced researchers, from postdocs onward (continuation in research)
 - **A2** research stays for young researchers, PhD level 

We have two additional types of top-up grants in combination with **A1** and **A2**, namely :

 - **B** for women
 - **C** for conference participation during a long research stay 

The yearly scientific budget is USD 41660

The following tables summarise the applications and grants that have been awarded in the different categories
