The maths-reviewing service zbMATH offers free access to mathematicians and institutions in many developing countries. The exact list of which countries are eligible has just been revised, and can be found <a href="/emscdc/zbmath2">here</a>. If you are a mathematician in one of these countries and would like access, then further information on how to obtain access can be found <a href="/emscdc/zbmath">here</a>.

If you are a mathematician who works in a developing country that is not on the aforementioned list, you may still be able to negotiate a free trial period. You are encouraged to email the editor of zbMATH with your request: <br><img src="/emscdc/zbmail.jpg">
