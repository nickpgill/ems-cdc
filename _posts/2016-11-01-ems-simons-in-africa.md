The African Continent is very diversified and the development of a career in mathematics faces different and sometimes difficult progression. The Committee for Developing Countries (CDC) of the EMS, with the support of the <a href = "https://www.simonsfoundation.org/">Simons Foundation</a>, opens a program of research visits to foster research opportunities for young and established researchers.

The full text of the call for applications is <a href = "http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/ems-simons-africa">here</a>. Enquiries about the programme can be emailed to <a href = "mailto:ems.simonsafrica@gmail.com">ems.simonsafrica@gmail.com</a>.
