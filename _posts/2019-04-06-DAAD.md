### DAAD In-Country/In-Region Scholarship

We have received a call for Scholarship Applications at Institut de Mathématiques et de Sciences Physiques (IMSP) in Benin.

The programme aims at fostering strong, internationally oriented higher education
systems in Sub-Saharan Africa with the capacity to contribute to sustainable
development. To this end, scholarships are granted for development-related
Master or doctoral studies for individuals who plan to pursue a career in teaching
and / or research at a higher education institution in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Applicants must first apply for studies at <a href = "http://www.imsp-benin.com/home/">IMSP</a> and, **once this is done*, apply for a scholarship. The scholarship application closing date is 6th June 2019.

Further details can found <a href = "https://nickpgill.github.io/emscdc/DAAD.pdf">in the attached document</a>. Interested candidates can also seek advice from the Programme Officer, Sylvanie Ouassika at **ouassika@daad.de**, or from the IMSP Contact Person, Léonard Todjihounde at **leonardt67@gmail.com**.
