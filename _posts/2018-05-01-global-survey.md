We are looking for respondents, men and women, in all fields represented by the partnering Unions and all regions of the world. You are welcome to answer the survey yourself and forward this link to the survey to your lists of contacts and you colleagues, men and women. 

Invitation letters to participate in the survey are available  for your use in seven languages <a href = "https://icsugendergapinscience.org/2018-global-survey-of-mathematical-computing-and-natural-scientists/">here</a>. You can simply copy the cover letter in the language(s) of your choice and send to your contacts, or use it to adapt it to the people you are writing to. The letter encourages recipients to send the survey to their colleagues. In this way, the survey will be disseminated further.
