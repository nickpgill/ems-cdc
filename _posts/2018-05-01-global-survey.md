We are looking for respondents, men and women, in all fields represented by the partnering Unions and all regions of the world. You are welcome to answer the survey yourself and forward this link to the survey to your lists of contacts and you colleagues, men and women. 

This survey is being organised by <a href = "https://icsugendergapinscience.org/">The Gender Gap in Science project</a>, funded by the International Council for Science (ICSU).  The project is collecting data to develop a broader picture of the status of mathematicians and scientists across the world. The results of this survey will provide data about the situation of scientists and mathematicians worldwide, as well as focused information about women in these fields. The data that you contribute will help inform interventions by ICSU and member unions to increase participation, especially for women.

Full information about the survey is available <a href = "https://statisticalresearchcenter.aip.org/cgi-bin/global18.pl?id=84850066&stage=5&sesid=1696&language=3">here</a>.
