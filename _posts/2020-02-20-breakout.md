Thanks to a generous donation by the winners of the Breakthrough Prizes in Mathematics – Ian Agol, Jean Bourgain, Simon Donaldson, Alex Eskin, Christopher Hacon, Maxim Kontsevich, Vincent Lafforgue, Jacob Lurie, James McKernan, Terence Tao and Richard Taylor – IMU with the assistance of <a href = "www.friends-imu.org">FIMU</a> is opening a new call of the IMU Breakout Graduate Fellowship program to support postgraduate studies, in a developing country, leading to a PhD degree in the mathematical sciences. The IMU Breakout Graduate Fellowships offers a limited number of complete grants, with duration of up to four years, for excellent students from developing countries.
 
Professional mathematicians are invited to nominate highly motivated and mathematically talented students from developing countries who plan to complete a doctoral degree in a developing country, including their own home country.

Nominees must have a consistently good academic record and must be seriously interested in pursuing a career of research and teaching in mathematics.
 
For a nomination to be eligible, the country of citizenship of the student, the country of residency and the country where the study will take place must be contained in the list of Developing Countries as <a href = "https://www.mathunion.org/cdc/about-cdc/definition-developing-countries">defined by IMU for the period 2019-2022</a>|. 
 
The 2020 call will be open from February 1 to May 30, 2020. More information <a href = "https://www.mathunion.org/cdc/scholarshipsgraduate-scholarships/imu-breakout-graduate-fellowship-program">here</a>.
