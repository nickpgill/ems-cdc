Applications are now open for the Professor Abbas Bahri Excellence Fellowship for Graduate Research in Mathematics for the Academic Year 2020-2021 with due date April 30, 2020.
The official announcement can be found <a href = "https://math.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-program/bahrief">here</a>.

The annual distribution and separate gifts are bringing the total available fund for the 2020-2021 awards up to 9,500 USD; in addition, the Math Department of Rutgers University has set aside $1,000 total to help defray travel expenses of awardee(s).

The award can be made to one or multiple recipients. It is anticipated that an award could support the visit of an international student to the Mathematics Department of Rutgers University, New Brunswick for a period of one to four months, or support a Rutgers student to give presentations or lectures at a conference or workshop, or to engage in scientific collaboration; an award can also be given to Rutgers student to carry out high quality dissertation work locally at Rutgers.

Each year, the number of awardees, and the type and the duration of the support provided will depend on the combined amounts of the actual annual distribution of the endowed fund and the potential separate annual gifts.

The administrators of the fellowship would like to thank the donors who have made this fellowship possible and are still contributing to augment the available fund. Thanks to their support, the two Inaugural Abbas Bahri Fellows for the academic year 2019-2020, Dr. Habib Fourti from Tunisia and Dr. Ignace Aristide Minlend from Senegal/Cameroon, are currently visiting the Math Department of Rutgers University for two months.

Additional donations are very welcome. Instructions on how to donate can be found on the bottom of <a href = "https://math.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-program/bahrief">this page</a>. Particularly encouraged are separate gifts to increase the annual available fund of the Abbas Bahri Fellowship for the academic year 2021-2022.
