# Aims and Objectives
We aim to assist developing countries in all possible ways. Some examples:
 * the development of mathematics curricula;
 * cooperation with local staff in conducting M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs;
 * helping to build up libraries;
 * helping to build up regional centres and networks;
 * providing information about further studies for students from developing regions;
 * sourcing funds for junior and senior researchers to attend conferences.

The CDC work is based on the volunteering participation of its members and associate members. We are full of ideas, and there is lots of work to be done.  We do not receive regular funding from our parent society <a href="http://euro-math-soc.eu/">EMS</a>, and so desperately need help from all mathematicians!

# Meetings
In 2018 the CDC will meet on Sigtuna, Sweden 6-7 April 2018. In 2017 the CDC met on 7-8 April at the Accademia dei Lincei, Rome, Italy.

During its annual meetings the CDC organises a round table for reflecting around various topics related to the promotion of mathematics worldwide. These meetings feature the participation of the CDC associate members and some institutes, associations, and centres sharing some of the same goals as the CDC.

The topic of this year's round table was: <i>Experiences about teaching mathematics:
from the Montessori method to the Mediterranean Championship.
The role of participation.</i>. More details can be found on the <a href="reports.php">reports page</a>.

# Activities

We started work in earnest in 2002. Since then we have expanded our aims and been involved in a number of projects.
 * <b>Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence (ERCE)</b>: 
This is a label of quality endorsed to such centres that offer training to Master and possibly PhD level to students from less developed countries in their regions and in such way effectively promote the  mathematics education and research development. For more details see <a href = "erce.php">here</a>.
 * <b>Work with the Simons Foundation</b>: In November 2016, with the support of the <a href="http://www.simonsfoundation.org">Simons Foundation</a>, the CDC opened a program of research visits to foster research opportunities for young and established researchers.
 * <b>Financial Support</b>: The CDC has a limited funding substantially from donor. This is used to in agreement with the aims and objectives of the CDC. 
A formal application for funding should be sent to the CDC at <i>CDC-apply@ems-cdc.org</i> by 15th March each year.
The requests will be considered by the CDC at its annual meeting and decision will be made.
The application should contain:
    1. Applicant name, title, affiliation, address, email address
    2. Motivation and background for the application, context
    3. Sum requested and budget frame (amounts already available or requested to other sponsors)
    4. Supporting material, e.g. CV, support letters, …
 *  <b>Book donation scheme</b>: We aim to send books donated by mathematicians in
the developed world to institutes and departments in the developing
world. We have received quite a number of generous offers: from
individuals who retire, from institutes/libraries getting rid of
excess stock, from libraries going digital, and also from publishers'
surplus.  We continue to welcome such generosity.<br/><br/>
On the other hand, we also have a list of recipients: those who have 
promised to make available to all local mathematicians freely the 
donated material, and to keep it in good condition. This list is 
ever expanding, and we welcome any such institutes to contact us for 
this purpose. <br/><br/>
The shipping costs are high, but we are supported 
financially, on a case-by-case basis, by 
<a href="http://math.ictp.it/">ICTP</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ams.org/programs/donations/donations">American Mathematical Society</a>, 
<a href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/index.html">London Mathematical Society</a>, 
<a href="http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/partners/">Zentralblatt</a>,
<a href="http://www.siu.no/en/Programme-overview/The-NUFU-programme">The Norwegian Programme for Development, Research and Education (NUFU)</a>, 
and also our own very limited funds. We have moved tens of tonnes of books and journals, from Europe, USA and Canada, to 
Africa, South East Asia, and South and Central America. 
<br/><br/>
Possible donor or recipients can contact <i>CDC-books@ems-cdc.org</i>.</p> 

# Other activities

 * <b>Agreement with <a href="http://www.zbmath.org/">zbMATH</a></b>: free access for Developing Countries. Details of this scheme are <a href="zbmath.php">here</a>.
 *  <b>Funding conferences</b>:  Decisions to support a conference are taken once a year, during our annual meeting in April. 
We have funded participants to ICM06 in Madrid, a speaker to Mongolia, part of a <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/">CIMPA</a> 
school, part of the <a href = "http://www.europeanwomeninmaths.org/resources/news/creation-awma-african-women-in-mathematics-association">2nd African Women Mathematics workshop</a>, and so on.
 *  <b>Electronic access</b>: One member of the committee, <a href="http://math.golonka.org/">Anders Wandahl</a>,  has run <a href = "http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php">four workshops on electronic access</a>. The first, in Addis Ababa, was facilitated with a grant from the 
<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/">International Mathematical Union (IMU)</a> and attracted 47 participants. The second took place in Bamako, Mali in November 2010 during a 
<a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/spip.php?article236">CIMPA Research 
School</a>. The other two were in Maputo and Phnom Penh.
<br>
Members of <b>Electronic access subcommittee</b>:  
<i>	 
<a href="http://www.dm.unito.it/~fino/">Anna Fino</a>,   	
<a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~miw/">Michel Waldschmidt</a>,
<a href="http://math.golonka.org/">Anders Wandahl</a></i> (Chair of the subcommittee).  The CDC is open to facilitate such activity at request of interested parties. To present a motion of interest please contact <i>CDC-apply@ems-cdc.org</i>.
<li> <b>Mentoring</b>: We participate in the project entitled <a href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/mentoring-african-research-mathematics">Mentoring African Research Mathematics (MARM)</a>.
 *  <b>Reduced EMS Membership</b>: A special reduced fee of 5€ for mathematicians who reside in a developing country from 
<a href="http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/reduced-membership-fees">this list </a> was established by our Committee.
More details on the advantages of membership can be found
<a href="http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/individual-members">on the EMS website</a>. 

# Past activities
 *  <b>Cambodian students</b>: We have supported a number of Cambodian students through their M.Sc. studies. In July 2013, we were
very pleased to receive news of the <a href = "http://www.lepetitjournal.com/cambodge/accueil/en-bref/159798-diplome-le-1er-docteur-en-math-du-cambodge">first PhD student in mathematics in Cambodia</a>.
 * <b>Conference discussions</b> We held a roundtable at 5ECM and a discussion group at ICM10.
 *  <b>Twinning</b>: Until 2012 we had a <a href = "twinning.php">twinning scheme</a> under which we could provide a starting seed grant of around 500 Euros to facilitate the twinning of departments in developed and developing regions. Since this program was not active for many months, it is is not continued, but we could revive it in case of need.
