  <b>
ERCE
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
After our call for application which appeared in the March 2011 issue
of the EMS Newsletter, the first Emerging Regional Centre of
Excellence has now been established.  We are very happy that
the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences (Director: Professor
Alla Ditta Raza Choudary) in Lahore, Pakistan is the first recipient
of this label, confirmed by an official letter from the EMS President,
Professor Marta Sanz-Sole.  An article about this Institute and the
ERCE scheme in general will appear in the next issue of the
Newsletter.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
In order to strengthen the meaning of this label, we are seeking to
fund a number of M.Sc. scholarships to the ASSMS for students coming
from neighbouring regions.

<br />   <b>
Institutional Collaboration
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

As now traditional, at our Annual General Meeting last April in Madrid
(thanks to our Spanish hosts) we invited the EMS President Professor 
Marta Sanz-Sole, the Chair of the IMU-CDC (Professor Jose Antonio de
la Pena), and the President of the Spanish society CeMAT (Professor
Antonio Campillo), as well as several members of CIMPA who are our
members and/or associate members.  Also among our members are those
who are involved in establishing the new Pan-African Centre of
Mathematics in close collaboration with Stockholm University. As a 
result of discussions, several meaningful collaborations are being now 
pursued.  Our ongoing collaboration with ISP and ICTP is of course
maintained. 


 <br />  <b>
Electronic Access 
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

We are continuing to hold electronic access workshops in Africa, and
also South-East Asia.  Following the success of these actual physical
<a href="http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php/">workshops</a> (conducted by our member <a href="http://math.golonka.se/">Anders Wandahl</a> , 
some with the help
of Michel Waldschmidt) a scheme of electronic workshops modelled on
them is now being worked out with the IMU-CDC.  These are partly
funded by a grant from  the latter.

<br /> 
  <b>
Zentralblatt
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

We continue to make use of the generous offer of Zentralblatt for free
access to developing countries.  The latest example is Malawi.  We are
grateful to Bernd Wegner and his colleagues for completing the
procedure in just a few days for Malawi.

<br /> 
  <b>
Book Donation Scheme
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

We continue with our book donation scheme, although we now think that
since many journals are available online, it is more worthwhile to
send just books.  We have recently opened up a new contact in Tibet,
with which we hope to continue with further action.

EMS-ERCE
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
      The label for EMS-Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence having been approved by EC, we have made a call for application/expression of interest which will appear in the March issue of the Newsletter:
<a href="http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2011-03-79.pdf">EMS Newsletter 79 (March 2011) p.11-12</a>.  It is also on the CDC website.  We plan to widely advertize this in
national mathematical societies.
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  The <a href="http://www.sms.edu.pk/">
Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences</a> of Lahore, Pakistan, has applied and been approved, with the strong support of the President.
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  We shall initiate discussions with the 
<a href="http://www.math.ac.vn/">Hanoi Institute of Mathematics of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology</a> about this label.
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  We are planning to design a 
<a href="http://newark.golonka.se/ems_erce.jpg">logo</a> which the centres may display if they wish and shall seek approval from EC once the design is in place.

<br />
<b>
Electronic access workshops 
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
      For the second year, we have received a grant of 2000 USD from IMU  to enable our member 
<a href="http://math.golonka.se/">Anders Wandahl</a> to continue holding 
<a href="http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php/">workshops on electronic access</a>.
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Two such workshops took place last year, one in 
<a href="http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php/docs/addis_ababa_oct_2010"> Addis Ababa</a> and one in 
<a href="http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php/docs/bamako_nov_2010">Bamako</a>, the latter as part of a CIMPA School.
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  We envisage to hold two more such workshops this year.

<br />
<b>
Collaboration with IMU 
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
      The President of IMU, together with the Chair of Policy of their CDC, proposed a collaboration with us to initiate a series of virtual workshops along the lines of the actual workshops on electronic access.  Anders Wandahl and TST are working out the practicalities and 
shall bring this for general discussion during our next Annual General Meeting next month.

<br />
<b>
Zentralblatt access 
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
       Levis Eneya, a former student of member Andreas Griewank who helped us organize the roundtable in Amsterdam during the last ECM, returned to his native country Malawi after obtaining his doctorate.  He  remembered the Zentralblatt free access for developing countries and asked us for help.  Bernd Wegner of Zentralblatt, an associate member, responded almost instantaneously and was able to register within days the library of Chancellor College, University of Malawi, at Zomba in Malawi for the free access.
 

<br />
<b>
Book donation scheme 

</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  With financial help from ICTP and advise from member Ramadas Ramakrishnan Trivandrum, a substantial consign was sent out from University of Durham.
  Smaller consigns are being sent out from Oxford.  A larger personal library, also from Oxford, is under negotiation.

<br />
<b>
Annual general meeting 

</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Our next general annual meeting shall be in Madrid on 2 April 2011, to be hosted by member Begona Vitoriano.  
  The President has kindly agreed to attend.  Other invited guests include Jose Antonio de la Pena (Chair of 
<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/organization/cdc/">Commission for Developing Countries (IMU-CDC)</a>), Antonio Campillo (President of <a href="">Comité Español de Matemáticas (CEMAT)</a>, Spain).

<b>Membership:</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  We have proposed to the EC to elect Ramadas Ramakrishnan Trivandrum, who has just succeeded Le Dung Trang as chair of mathematics at ICTP.

<br />  
<b>
Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence (ERCE):
</b> 
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Mireille Martin-Deschamps and TST hope to present this in person to the EC, with a more detailed project.

<br />
<b>
Electronic access:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Our member Anders Wandahl, with a grant from the IMU, held a workshop on electronic access, which attracted 47 participants.  He
will do another workshop later this month in Bamako during a CIMPA School.

<br />
<b>
Book donation:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    We are currently trying to send two substantial personal libraries.

<br />
<b>
Donation from reviewers of Zentralblatt:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    We continue to receive donations on a regular basis.  This year we had an additional donation of 578.29 € from one Japanese reviewer, which we find quite wonderful.

<br />
<b>
ICTP meeting:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    ICTP is holding a high-profile meeting called "ICTP after 45 years",  8-10 November, 2010, to which TST is invited.  She hopes to be able to report
some of our activities there.
