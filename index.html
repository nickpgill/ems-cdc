ERCE is a label awarded by the EMS to centres showing an outstanding level in its area of influence in research and education, being attractor of students from other regions and countries. Indeed the education of Master and PhD students is an asset for raising the quality and the diffusion of mathematics worldwide and it has particular value in the developing world. ERCE centres are selected among those which play an important role in training students in their region particularly coming from less developed areas and countries. More information about the scheme is given <a href = "erce.php">here</a>.
</p><p>
With the success of this scheme the committee is now opening a new call for applications. The application has to be sent by e-mail to the address <i>ems-office@helsinki.fi</i> and the deadline for this application is February 15th, 2018. Full details are <a href="Call-ERCE5.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
The London Mathematical Society (LMS) and the International Mathematical Union (IMU) Commission for Developing Countries in association with the African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative (AMMSI) are seeking applications for grants to support mathematics and its teaching in universities in Africa.  Four mentoring partnerships are to be awarded, each for a duration of two years.
</p><p> 
The project is designed to counter the mathematics ‘brain-drain’ by supporting qualified mathematics professionals in situ.  Continuing professional links to a centre in the developed world, professional mentoring and opportunities for periodic research travel, will contribute to the possibility and relative attractiveness of contributing one’s mathematical expertise at home rather than moving permanently to the developed world.

<b>Background on the prize</b>: On February 3, 2008 Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh was kidnapped from his home in N'Djamena by the Chadian armed forces. He died presumably within the next few days, in detention. Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh was a professor and former rector of the University of N'Djamena. Former government minister, he was one of the leading figures of the democratic opposition in Chad. He was instrumental in inter-university agreements linking Chad to France and other African countries. He wanted these agreements to contribute to the quality of teacher education in his country.
</p><p>
The French Society of Statistics (SFdS), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SMAI) and the Mathematical Society of France (SMF) initiated in 2009 an award in his memory to continue his commitment to quality training of young African mathematicians.
</p><p>
The Prize "Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh" is awarded annually. It allows a student of an institution of Central Africa or West Africa (*), in mathematical sciences, at the graduate or post-graduate level, to benefit a scientific training in a country other than his/her own.

The next International Congress of Mathematicians will take place in Seoul, Korea, from Wednesday August 13, through Thursday
August 21, 2014. 1,000 mathematicians from developing countries will be invited to
Korea during ICM 2014 under the ICM 2014 signature travel grant
program, called <i>NANUM 2014</i>. Travel grants awarded will be in the range of approximately USD1500 -USD2500 per person.
</p>
<p>The first deadline for NANUM applications has passed. However, by popular demand, the submission site will be re-opened on Oct. 16, 2013
and will remain open until Oct. 31, 2013. We hope that this grace
period may enable the people who missed the deadline to submit their
applications. To submit an application, or to find out me, visit the <a href = "http://www.nanum2014.org/home.php">NANUM 2014</a> homepage.

<p>
The latest <a href = "http://www.mathunion.org/IMU-Net/">newsletter of the International Mathematical Union</a> has a number of interesting announcements, of which we mention two:
</p>
<h3>Establishment of AMMSI regional office in North Africa</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.ammsi.org">African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative (AMMSI)</a> is a
distributed network of mathematics research, training and promotion in
Africa. Initially the network operated only in
Sub-Saharan Africa but, in August 2013, it was extended to North
Africa.
</p><p>
By joining AMMSI, North Africa will now benefit from a number of
activities and projects which include: (a) Annual postgraduate
scholarships, funded by IMU/CDC (b) MARM, a project which promotes
mentorship and linkages and is implemented in collaboration with IMU
and the London Mathematical Society (LMS) (c) Conference grants to
enable postgraduate students attend conferences in Africa, funded by
LMS. Envisaged future activities include visiting and postdoctoral
fellowships, research funding, and support for organization of
scientific meetings.
</p>
<h3>TWAS: Free access to mathematical literature for developing countries</h3>
<p>
<a href = "http://twas.ictp.it/">TWAS, the World Academy of Sciences for the advancement of science in
developing countries</a>offers access to <a href = "http://twas.ictp.it/links/open-access-scientific-information.">a lot of
scientific resources</a> (including mathematics), which are either
1. "Open Access", 2. freely accessible for developing countries, or 3.
accessible at reduced price for developing countries.
</p><p>
The special access to scientific literature for developing countries
is through <a href = "http://www.research4life.org/">research4life.org</a>, which consists of the four
networks HINARI, AGORA, OARE and ARDI. The ARDI network is the most
relevant for mathematicians. On <a href = "http://www.wipo.int/ardi/en/">their website</a>
one can click in the left column on "Journals" and find the list of
journals  concerned by this program. These journals are either
freely accessible or accessible at reduced price to the scientists in approved countries.
</p><p>
For researchers who cannot easily download material, the Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) offers to send articles in mathematics and
physics as email attachments. This is offered through the <a href = "http://ejds.ictp.it/ejds">electronic
Journals Delivery Service (eJDS)</a> which requires registration and is cost-free.

The Organizing Committee of the International Congress of Mathematicians 2014 is inviting 1000 mathematicians in developing countries to Korea to participate in ICM 2014. This scheme is known as <a href = "http://www.nanum2014.org/home.php">NANUM 2014</a> and more information can be found by following the link.
</p><p>
Note that the official deadline for applications has passed! However it is still possible for people to apply - in particular the organisers of this scheme are committed to sending at least 100 women from developing countries to ICM 2014. Any interested women can contact NANUM 2014 direct, or communicate with <a href = "http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/members.php">members of the EMS-CDC</a>.

<p>
Springer Verlag has launched an initiative called <a href = "http://www.springer.com/authors/oba?SGWID=0-1726313-0-0-0">Springer Book Archives</a> where each author of a book published by Springer is requested to give his or
her consent for the book to be included in this database. The forms to be filled
include the following option:
<blockquote>
You will receive royalties, or can choose to waive them in support of charitable
organizations such as INASP or Research4Life, that help provide the
developing world with access to scientific research.
</blockquote></p><p>
We invite all authors who wish to do so to <a href="http://www.springer.com/authors/oba?SGWID=0-1726313-12-849404-0">send a message to Springer</a> requesting that Springer support the European Mathematical Society and its
Committee for Developing Countries. At present the only
regular income for the EMS-CDC is via reviewers' donations of their honoraria
through Zentralblatt. Support through the Springer scheme would greatly aid
the <a href = "activities.php">committee's ongoing work</a> facilitating access to mathematical education
and knowledge in the developing world.
</p><p>
<i>A request for support using this scheme has appeared in a recent <a href = "springer_initiative.pdf">EMS newsletter</a>.
