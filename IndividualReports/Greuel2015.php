Report on the CDC-related zbMATH activities for the EMS-CDC Meeting in
Oslo, April 10â€“11 2015.
</i></p>
<ol>
<li> As in previous years the honorarium donated to the CDC by the
zbMATH-reviewers has been collected at zbMATH and transferred to the
CDC. The precise amount for the last years will be given during the
meeting.
<li><p>The zbMATH Coordinating Committee (CC) agreed to offer open access
for institutions and colleagues in DCs also for 2015. This offer had
started as an initiative of the EMS when the EMS became an editorial
institution of zbMATH. The list itself is discussed among members of
the CC and CDC and with our service provider Springer, who is
responsible for marketing and invoicing. The list of countries who
benefit from this offer will be annually updated. The list for 2015
can be found <a href = "List-FreeAccessDC-2015.pdf">here</a>.
</p><p>
Often we get requests from colleagues from DCs for individual free
access. It ususlly takes only 2 to 3 days to provide such access if
their countries are on the list. I like to ask the members of the CDC
to continue to inform institutions and individual mathematicians about
this possibility.
</p>
<li> The database zbMATH has significantly improved during the last
period. I will give an overview on the new achievements and further
plans during the meeting. For a short overview see <a href = "Report_on_zbMATH.pdf">here</a>.

<li>For a more detailed report reflecting the oral presentation during
the meeting, including IMAGINARY activities in Africa, look <a href = "GMG2015.pdf">here</a>.
