<h2>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OF EMS</h2>
  Tsou Sheung Tsun, Michel Waldschmidt
(26.06.11).
 <p>
  <b>
ERCE
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
After our call for application which appeared in the March 2011 issue
of the EMS Newsletter, the first Emerging Regional Centre of
Excellence has now been established.  We are very happy that
the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences (Director: Professor
Alla Ditta Raza Choudary) in Lahore, Pakistan is the first recipient
of this label, confirmed by an official letter from the EMS President,
Professor Marta Sanz-Sole.  An article about this Institute and the
ERCE scheme in general will appear in the next issue of the
Newsletter.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
In order to strengthen the meaning of this label, we are seeking to
fund a number of M.Sc. scholarships to the ASSMS for students coming
from neighbouring regions.

<br />   <b>
Institutional Collaboration
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

As now traditional, at our Annual General Meeting last April in Madrid
(thanks to our Spanish hosts) we invited the EMS President Professor 
Marta Sanz-Sole, the Chair of the IMU-CDC (Professor Jose Antonio de
la Pena), and the President of the Spanish society CeMAT (Professor
Antonio Campillo), as well as several members of CIMPA who are our
members and/or associate members.  Also among our members are those
who are involved in establishing the new Pan-African Centre of
Mathematics in close collaboration with Stockholm University. As a 
result of discussions, several meaningful collaborations are being now 
pursued.  Our ongoing collaboration with ISP and ICTP is of course
maintained. 


 <br />  <b>
Electronic Access 
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

We are continuing to hold electronic access workshops in Africa, and
also South-East Asia.  Following the success of these actual physical
<a href="http://workshop.ems-cdc.org/doku.php/">workshops</a> (conducted by our member <a href="http://math.golonka.se/">Anders Wandahl</a> , 
some with the help
of Michel Waldschmidt) a scheme of electronic workshops modelled on
them is now being worked out with the IMU-CDC.  These are partly
funded by a grant from  the latter.

<br /> 
  <b>
Zentralblatt
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

We continue to make use of the generous offer of Zentralblatt for free
access to developing countries.  The latest example is Malawi.  We are
grateful to Bernd Wegner and his colleagues for completing the
procedure in just a few days for Malawi.

<br /> 
  <b>
Book Donation Scheme
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;

We continue with our book donation scheme, although we now think that
since many journals are available online, it is more worthwhile to
send just books.  We have recently opened up a new contact in Tibet,
with which we hope to continue with further action.
