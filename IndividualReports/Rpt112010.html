<h2>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OF EMS</h2>
  Tsou Sheung Tsun, Michel Waldschmidt
(01.11.10).
 <p>
<b>Membership:</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  We have proposed to the EC to elect Ramadas Ramakrishnan Trivandrum, who has just succeeded Le Dung Trang as chair of mathematics at ICTP.

<br />  
<b>
Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence (ERCE):
</b> 
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Mireille Martin-Deschamps and TST hope to present this in person to the EC, with a more detailed project.

<br />
<b>
Electronic access:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Our member Anders Wandahl, with a grant from the IMU, held a workshop on electronic access, which attracted 47 participants.  He
will do another workshop later this month in Bamako during a CIMPA School.

<br />
<b>
Book donation:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    We are currently trying to send two substantial personal libraries.

<br />
<b>
Donation from reviewers of Zentralblatt:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    We continue to receive donations on a regular basis.  This year we had an additional donation of 578.29 â‚¬ from one Japanese reviewer, which we find quite wonderful.

<br />
<b>
ICTP meeting:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    ICTP is holding a high-profile meeting called "ICTP after 45 years",  8-10 November, 2010, to which TST is invited.  She hopes to be able to report
some of our activities there.
