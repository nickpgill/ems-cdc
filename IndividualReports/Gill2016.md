<p>
My primary role with the EMS-CDC is to update the website. I did this throughout the year. There have been few major changes, although I did rejig the ERCE pages so that each ERCE institution now has its own page.
</p><p>
I have not travelled to any developing countries in the last year, however I will participate in a programme to teach a Masters level Galois theory course in Nepal this year. The course starts soon; my 2 week module is in the first half of June. To support this I have obtained funding from the London Mathematical Society -- I am very grateful for this funding which will cover all expenses for my component of the course.
</p><p>
I am keen to continue being involved with EMS-CDC, and will happily take on more responsibilities should that be required, and should I be able.
