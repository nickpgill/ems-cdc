<b>Membership:</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  We have proposed to the EC to elect Ramadas Ramakrishnan Trivandrum, who has just succeeded Le Dung Trang as chair of mathematics at ICTP.

<br />

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Mireille Martin-Deschamps and TST hope to present this in person to the EC, with a more detailed project.

Electronic access:
</b>
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Our member Anders Wandahl, with a grant from the IMU, held a workshop on electronic access, which attracted 47 participants.  He
will do another workshop later this month in Bamako during a CIMPA School.

    We continue to receive donations on a regular basis.  This year we had an additional donation of 578.29 â‚¬ from one Japanese reviewer, which we find quite wonderful.

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp;
    ICTP is holding a high-profile meeting called "ICTP after 45 years",  8-10 November, 2010, to which TST is invited.  She hopes to be able to report
