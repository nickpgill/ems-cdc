Between the meeting in Olso in April 2015 and the meeting in Trieste (ICTP) in April 2016, my main activities related with EMS-CDC have been the following ones. I had a number of visits in developing countries (see <a href = "http://www.math.jussieu.fr/%7Emiw/AgendaArchives.html">my web site</a>); some of these visits gave rise to a <a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/%7Emiw/cooperations.html">report</a>. 

 * In my report last year, I mentioned that 164 books collected at the end of ICM 2014 - see my <a href ="http://www.imj-prg.fr/%7Emichel.waldschmidt/EMS-CDC/ReportICM2014.pdf">short report on ICM 2014</a> (EMS Newsletter December 2014) - had been sent to Africa. Among them, 121 were sent to the <a href ="http://imsp-benin.com/home/">Institut de Mathematiques et de Sciences Physiques (IMSP)</a>, Dangbo. They reached Benin in March 2015. The other ones were sent at the same time to Senegal, and finally they reached Bambey only in March 2016, one year later! I received a letter with acknowledgement of receipt from the Rector of the University of Alioume Diop of Bambey, Pr Lamine Gueye. The list includes 27 books + 41 issues of "Le Monde est Mathematique".
