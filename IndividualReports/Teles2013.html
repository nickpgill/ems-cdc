<h2>Report by Joana Teles (April 2013)</h2>
<p>I´m involved in a mathematics olympiad for portuguese speaking 
countries. The aim of this competition is to create an
opportunity for the exchange and sharing of national experiencesand  to 
promote the teaching and dissemination of Mathematics in
Portuguese speaking countries. An Olympic Week will take place before 
the competition, offering courses in mathematics, which will allowall 
participants (non-university students) to improve their performance in 
future competitions. The invited countries are Portugal, Brasil, Angola, 
São Tomé and Principe, Guine Bissau, Cape Verde, Mozambique and East Timor.
</p><p>
  The first edition was held in Coimbra, Portugal, in 2011, with 6 
countries participating with students (São Tomé and Principe and Guine 
Bissau participated with an observer). The second one was held last year 
in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil with 7 countries with students (just missed 
Guine Bissau).  This year this olympiad will happen in Maputo, 
Mozambique, next July. I support all the local organizations and try to 
share my experience with them. In 2014, East Timor plans to organize 
this event.
</p><p>
  We have some contacts in Angola, Cape Verde,  São Tome and Principe, 
Mozambique and East Timor, to begin to share our experience in problem 
solving and maths competitions with teachers from all these countries. I 
hope to visit Mozambique next August or September.
