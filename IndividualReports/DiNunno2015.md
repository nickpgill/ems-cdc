<h2>Giulia di Nunno</h2>
<p>In the EMS-CDC I am vice-chair of the committee and part of the ERCE sub-committee. The was no call of interest opened for ERCE this year, but a discussion on the diffusion of the ERCE label and the post ERCE (that is afte the first 4 years) is ongoing and will be discussed at the next meeting of the committee. I have organised the CDC meeting 2015 of the committee in Oslo.
</p><p>
I continue being involved in CIMPA both as Steering committee member, representing Norwegian Mathematical Society and in the active work of Regional Scientific Officer for Sub-Saharan Africa. In this I share the work with Sylvain Duquesne (Univ. Rennes).
</p><p>
I continue the work of the Equipe-Africain within CIMPA, that pools together all people involved directly into the organisation of CIMPA events in the continent and analyses, proposes, and monitors special activities with the scope of a broader and intensive development of the mathematics in this continent. The meetings in this team are usually held by telephone-conference. Particular effort is directed to the promotion of the EMA (Ecole Mathematique Africaine), which are mathematical schools at master level in selected topics. This activity of CIMPA is carried through in direct collaboration with the UMA (Union Mathematique Africaine).
</p><p>
I am part of the selection committee for the EMA together with some colleagues at CIMPA and from the UMA. Specifically proactive in the preparation of applications of research schools for 2015, 2016.
</p><p>
 In 2014 I have participated at the CIMPA school in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and the SAMSA conference in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe 
</p><p>
I am at present supervising a master student from Marocco and a PhD student enrolled at Yound√© I, Cameroon.</p>
