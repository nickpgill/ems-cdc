<li>I was one of the directors of <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/spip.php?article567">CIMPA research school</a> in M'Bour 
Senegal in june 2014. I am CIMPA advisor, and a member of the CIMPA Africa team  which meets by 
telephone about three times a year and discuss activities past and future.
<li> I was on the scientific committee and one of the lecturers at an 
<a href = "http://nlaga-simons.ucad.sn/index.php/new-international-events">African Mathematical School on Complex and real geometry and applications</a> in Ziguinchor, Senegal in march 2015.
<li> I was a lecturer in a NLAGA project meeting in Niamey Niger in october 
2017.
<li> I am a member of the executive committee a club of french universities 
and research institutions acting for mathematics in subsaharan Africa, 
<a href = "http://sarima.edu-math.org/">SARIMA</a>
(unfortunately the SARIMA website has not been updated recently, we are 
working on that).
</i> I am together with Jean Laurent in charge of the <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/spip.php?article454">Ibni Prize</a>. 
<li>I am a facilitator of two of the Simons Foundation Africa Mathematics 
projects. <a href = "http://nlaga-simons.ucad.sn/>">NLAGA</a>, devoted to pde, 
geometry and applications is based mainly in Senegal, with members in 
Niger, Mali, Tchad, etc .... <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/ezometony/home/prmais">Primais</a> 
 with members in Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal is devoted to cryptology  and coding theory, 
and uses number theory and algebraic geometry.
<li> I am preparing with Jean-Fran&ccediloise Dupuy an application for 
a Groupement de Recherche International from CNRS for Mathematics in 
subsaharan Africa.
<li>I am a member of the joint AMU-CIMPA which is selecting African 
Mathematical Schools. I was co-chairing the committee with Saliou Toure 
till march 2015.
<li>I am a member of the international organization committee of the 
AMUCWA-AWMA Conference (and First AWMA General Meeting), Kenya, 2015:

 About CIMPA activities:  CIMPA considers subsaharian Africa as a 
priority zone for its activities.
Main CIMPA activities in subsaharian Africa are
<ul>
<li>research schools (8 research schools in 2016)
<li>African Mathematical Schools organized jointly with AMU (7 
schools in 2015)
<li>women in mathematics workshop, jointly with AMU (the first one 
in Ouagadougou in 2012, the second one in AIMS South Africa in 2013, the 
third is planed in Kenay 2015). The <a href = "http://www.europeanwomeninmaths.org/resources/news/creation-awma-african-women-in-mathematics-association">African Women in Mathematics 
Association</a> was created in 2013 at AIMS South Africa .
<li>support to various training activities in mathematical research. See <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/">here</a> and, more specifically, here <a href = "http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/spip.php?rubrique45&lang=en">here</a>.
