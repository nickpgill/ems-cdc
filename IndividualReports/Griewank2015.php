<h2>Report by Andreas Griewank (April 2015)</h2>
<p><ol>
<li> I am writing from Ekaterinburg in the Urals where I give a short course
on Nonsmooth optimization, which I developed partially for a DAAD summer
school that I gave last summer in Novi Sad Serbia. Apart from a purely
scientific motivation I believe that it is very important to maintain the
dialogue with countries that have been designated pariahs by some mostly
ill-informed politicians in the West. Especially here in Russia the poor
command of English amongst students and staff is a real obstacle to
scientific exchange and development. The library for students of the Ural
Federal University has practically no English language books and much of
the stuff appears dated and a little insular. Yes, I try to learn Russian
but realistically, won't ever reach enough proficiency to deliver a talk
in it.

<li> At Humboldt I graduated two PhD students from Syria, whose results were
pretty marginal, which was reflected in their grade.  One of them had a
brother killed by a sniper one month before his defense; where he stood is
not clear to me. My wife consented for us to guarantee  support for his
youngest brothers so that he can come to Germany as a political  refugee
and continue studying chemistry, rather than being drafted into the Syrian
army. I do not find movies glorifying the 'service' of snipers to 'their
country' or possibly even 'mankind' particularly recommendable.

<li> I reached my official retirement age on March 31 but got one year
extension at Humboldt. Nevertheless, I am looking for a new job, hopefully
in the context of developing countries. Paul Vaderlind and Michel
Waldtschmidt have made helpful suggestions, which I am following up. An
English colleague gave my name to a head hunter, who is looking for senior
faculty for the new university Yachay some 70 kilometers north of Quito.
This is a special project of Raffael Correa the just reelected president
of Ecuador, left-leaning "but" well-eductaed and wordly-wise. I have been
interviewed and visited the place in late March. Very interesting in many
respects as I will discuss at Oslo.
