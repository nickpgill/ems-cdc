<h2>Report of activities in 2014-2015 by Stefano Luzzato
</h2>
 
<body>
<p>My activity in 2014 has been focussed on building relations and exploring opportunities for projects mainly in three countries: Senegal, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. 
</p><p>
In June 2014 I co-organized together with Marcelo Viana (IMPA) and Idris Assani (North Carolina) a two week <a href = "http://indico.ictp.it/event/a13242/">Dynamical Systems school</a> in Senegal, in partnership with the Simons Foundation supported research group <a href = "http://nlaga-simons.ucad.sn">NLAGA</a>. The school was held on the campus of <a href = "http://www.aims-senegal.org">AIMS-Senegal</a> in Mbour. One important feature of this school is that we accepted and supported also students from Europe and the US and I believe this was an extremely important and successful decision. During the school we had a meeting with the Minister of Research Mary Tuew Niane to explore avenues of collaboration with ICTP and a request was made to help organize a "Diploma Programme" analogous to that which exists at ICTP. Discussion on this project are in progress. 
</p><p>
In March 2014 I visited Raza Choudary at the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences in Lahore, and this visit led to a Federation Agreement between ICTP and the new <a href = "http://itu.edu.pk/research/abdus-salam-international-center-of-mathematics/">Abdus Salam International Center for Mathematics (AICM)</a> to which Dr Choudary has now moved. This agreement allows young researchers to visit ICTP. The visit also led to a new scheme, part of the ICTP Visiting Scholars programme, where several senior and junior researchers in Dynamical Systems will give a coordinated series of lectures at AICM. 
</p><p>
In March 2014 I also visited Tashkent and Samarkand in Uzbekistan. This visit also led to a Federation Agreement and to a major research grant being awarded by ICTP to Prof Dzhalilov at Turin Polytechnic in Tashkent. 
</p><p>
Additional activities include an invited plenary lecture at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Nigerian Mathematical Society held at the African University of Science and Technology (AUST), and a course of lectures at the CIMPA school "Aspects of Dynamical Systems" in Kathmandu, Nepal. 
</p>
<p>
At the Oslo meeting I presented a brief report on some important activity at ICTP. The slides are <a href = "Luzzato2015.pdf">here</a>.
