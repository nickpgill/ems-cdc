<h2>Giulia di Nunno</h2>
<p>From 2016 I have been nominated chair of the EMS-CDC hence most of the work is involved in this committee.
</p><p>
Major lines of activities have been in relationship with the ERCE program and some visiting program. At the end of 2015 there was a new call for ERCE and a good number of applications have been received. Necessary evaluations procedures, discussions and the interlinks with the EMS-EC have been put in place. Moreover, the discussion on a grant program for visiting position has also been started within the committee in connection of some upcoming funding possibilities. The organisation of the annual CDC meeting was carried through with Fernando Villegas at ICTP.
</p><p>
I continue being involved in CIMPA both as Steering committee member, representing Norwegian Mathematical Society and in the active work of Regional Scientific Officer for Sub-Saharan Africa. In this I share the work with Sylvain Duquesne (Univ. Rennes).
</p><p>
I continue the work of the Equipe-Africain within CIMPA, that pools together all people involved directly into the organisation of CIMPA events in the continent and analyses, proposes, and monitors special activities with the scope of a broader and intensive development of the mathematics in this continent. The meetings in this team are usually held by telephone-conference. Particular effort is directed to the promotion of the EMA (Ecole Mathematique Africaine), which are mathematical schools at master level in selected topics. This activity of CIMPA is carried through in direct collaboration with the UMA (Union Mathematique Africaine).
</p><p>
I am part of the selection committee for the EMA together with some colleagues at CIMPA and from the UMA. Specifically proactive in the preparation of applications of research schools for 2016, 2017.
</p><p>
In 2015 I have participated at the CIMPA school in Ziguinchor and in 2016 to the one in Saint-Louis. Both in Senegal. Moreover, I have been taking part at the SAMSA 2015 in Windoek, Namibia. In all these places new connection have been found.
</p><p>
I am at present involved in the supervision of a PhD student enrolled at Yound√© I, Cameroon and partially a PhD student from Marocco enrolled in Oslo. I have been nominated board member of ISP, Sweden..</p>
