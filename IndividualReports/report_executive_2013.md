<h2>Short report for the meeting of the Executive Council of the EMS, April 20, 2013</h2>
<p align=center><i>Michel Waldschmidt, 9 April 2013</i></p>
<p>One of the first activities of this committee has been the book donation scheme. We pursue this scheme, we receive a number of offers of books from Europe, USA, Canada, we move them to Africa, South East Asia, and South and Central America. We have a list of libraries in developing countries which are willing to receiving such documents, and we have limited funds to ship them. One of our support is ICTP. New donors and recipients are always welcome. 
</p><p>
We support students from developing countries to pursue their studies in an institution from a neighboring country in a south-south perspective. Thanks to the support from EMS through our committee, five students from Cambodia are preparing a Master Thesis in Philippines (2012-2014) and one student from Indonesia is currently preparing a PhD in Pakistan (2012-). Under our Twinning Programme, we can provide a starting seed grant of around 500 Euros to facilitate the twinning of departments in developed and developing regions. 
</p><p>
One main recent activity is related with the label Emerging Regional Centres of Excellence (ERCE). We select institutions for their high scientific and  pedagogical standards;  they offer training at M.Sc. level to students from less developed countries in their surrounding international region. So far only one institutions received this label, namely the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences of Lahore in Pakistan. Expressions of Interest in the ERCE programme has been requested in October 2012, four applications have been received.  All this is done in close contact with Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (CIMPA), The International Science Programme at Uppsala University (ISP) (Sweden), The Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) (Germany). Our sponsors are Les Amis d'Artur Besse, ICTP, IMU, ISP, LMS, NUFU, Swiss Mathematical Society, ZentralblattMATH and their reviewers, Donations to EMS, EMS Membership. 
</p><p>
Our annual meeting in 2013 will take place in Linköping (Sweden) on April 20. The report I gave at the Meeting of the Presidents organized by the European Mathematical Society in Aarhus on April 6, 2013 is available <a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~miw/articles/pdf/EMS-CDC06042013VI.pdf">on my web site</a>. The <a href = "http://euro-math-soc.eu/EMS-CDC/">website of our committee</a>provides more information: composition (11 members and 15 associate members), activities, book donation, ERCE, twinning project, reports.
