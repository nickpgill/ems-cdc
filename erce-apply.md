If you decide to apply, please take careful note of the following: For your application to be successful, the application must contain basic information like the name and place of the institution, academic affiliation, address and other relevant contact information. If a multi university center, clarify the institution's position in the academic structure.

The application must also elaborate in detail on all the <a href = "erce-criteria">criteria</a> for participation - but especially 4, 5, 7 and 8 - how and when these criteria can be met in the institution's specific context.It's helpful if you provide your research output in terms of publications for the last ten years."
